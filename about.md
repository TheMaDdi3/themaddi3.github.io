Welcome to my MAD.lair. I'm Dave. Or MaDdi3. Or Davide Milano. I had some names :)

This is an archive, a lab, a sketchpad - a place where I collect experiments, ideas, notes, and thoughts that would otherwise get lost in the folds of my phone or buried in my mind.

I work in user experience and study mathematics, this last one more out of curiosity and stubborn love. I’m also a roleplaying game enthusiast (and sometimes designer): I co-designed *Historia* and *Cowboy Bebop – The Roleplaying Game*, both published by <a href="https://manaprojectstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mana Project Studio</a>.

I used to play the clarinet. I was quite good but too but my cats voted for silence, so I switched to piano. I like music - I'm trying to get back in that spot where I don't need to actively think in order to play. In time. The cats like it, for now that's enough.

I discovered I’m neurodivergent (AuDHD) later in life, and after a long pause, I'm back on math. A goal is in sight :)

I’m also trying to re-learn how to write, quite a long time it's been.

**Wanna contact me?** If you know me, you probably already know how to find me. For everyone else, I'm still dropping by sometimes on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dm_maddi3/), but to have some more reliable contact... that will take some time ;)
