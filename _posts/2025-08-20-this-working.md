I'm studying for two exams.
Both about calculus, one focuses on $\mathcal{L}^p$ spaces, Fourier series and transformations, the other one is about PDE, Partial Derivates Equations.

They are both super-interesting, my main problem is to study as a student after a quarter century of not-being a student. I'm finding _easier_ to write pretty much a whole book about the subject in order to streamline and clean all the informations (and re-learn LaTeX code, which will be useful for the final thesis).

For example, I'm on the Heat Diffusion Equations, $u_t+D\Delta u=0$ and - wait, does this format correctly on the website?

Ouff. Let's check it out...
